The programs and strategies under this initiative will address a vast number of the issues of sustainable livelihood, skill up-gradation, innovative sustainable job creation and balanced development.   Background and Introduction Skills from the sector of traditional knowledge would refer to a set of practices and innovations developed by local communities over time and are in  constant state of change also called in colloquial language as .  A considerable number of these traditional skills are valuable for the contemporary society and such practices will have to be conserved by upgrading and capacity building of local population. These skills have borne the brunt of colonization, urbanization, globalization and migration leading to depletion of traditional consumer base and lowering the ranks of persons who wish to carry on the tradition. In many ways this is leading to deskilling and diminishing of these skilled communities. Agencies throughout the world are seeking innovative solutions to preserve skills belonging to the sector of traditional knowledge, thus there is a pressing need to initiate a course of action that will pave the way for economic viability and generate sustainable livelihood for the skill bearers which enable them to be closer to contemporary economic frameworks.   National cultural skill mapping is a comprehensive study to define, categorise and examine traditional, creative and cultural industries, including traditional handicraft, cultural heritage, performing art, visual arts and other dying arts. This activity will help create detailed methodologies to optimise economic potential of the sector through relevant skill mapping.     4   Scope of Work  It is envisioned that this exercise will percolate into local job creation hand in hand with ecological based development to sustain social groups in their own environment and prevent migration.  The larger frame of reference would indeed cover activities ranging from practices related to agriculture, natural resources and habitats that get manifested in crafts, performing arts, festivities, linguistics, healing practices, rituals, lifestyles and range of activities that have sustained local communities in synergy with environment. One of the objectives of the project would be empowerment of local community, ecological development, and capacitate endorsement of democracy at grassroots.  First Phase  The first phase will include the following activities: 1. Identifying three states for national cultural skill mapping from either the northern, southern or central region of India (which the proposed knowledge partner agency in its proposal will need to describe and suggest). Refer to the list of states below.  North (Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal)  South (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu)  Central (Gujrat, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha)  2. District wise Skill mapping would be done for all the three states.  3. Illustration of methodologies of mapping traditional knowledge skills in the suggested states.  4. The re-positioning skill program will include capacity building, local job creation, cultural sensitivity and cultural impacts including gender roles and ensuring responsible ecological and well balanced development.   5. The cultural skill mapping and the re-positioning skill development program will ensure inclusion of a wide spectrum of stakeholders from various fields such as private corporate players, NGOs, educational institutions, private individuals, grass root governing bodies, intergovernmental agencies both at the central and state levels to come in and play significant roles.  5    1.   1.
